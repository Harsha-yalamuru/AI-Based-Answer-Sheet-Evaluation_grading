Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns . not only the underlying patterns in the training data but also the noise and random fluctuations . This leads to excellent performance on training data but poor generalization ! to unseers or test data " Causes of ourfitting include : A complex model with too many parameters 2 . Insufficient training data 6 . 3 . Noise in the data , 4 . Too many training epochs . 6 Promotion techniques : 1 . Reducing number of Parameters 2 . Using Cross validation to validate Ubeen data . 3 . Collecting more training data .
